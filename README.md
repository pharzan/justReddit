# Just Reddit

An opensource react native Reddit browser application.

## Description

This repository is a basic reddit browser application. The app intends to create a more twitter like experience 
with an offline browsing capability.
This project is my starting point project to learn react and react native.

## Getting started

To start off clone the repository and install the dependencies. The app is made using Expo so you may need to have a look at 
the [Expo tutorial](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/) to get started.

After installing Expo on your local machine you can install the Expo mobile application for live development and debugging 
on your mobile device from [here](https://expo.io/tools#client).

## Built with
